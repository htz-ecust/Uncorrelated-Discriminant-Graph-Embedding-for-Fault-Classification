# Uncorrelated Discriminan Graph Embedding for Fault Diagnosis


- Code for paper "Uncorrelated Discriminant Graph Embedding for Fault Diagnosis".
- Unzip the dataset file "TE_dataset.zip" in the same directory with the matlab files.
- Run the code "UDGE_demo.m" or paste the code into the command window of matlab to run the code.
- The demo is designed for the fault modes in Case 1.
- The outputs include the final projection matrix of NDGE, the accuracies of different dimensions, and the probabilities of each samples to different fault modes.
- the plot of the accuracies of different dimensions will be obtained after the running of the code.
- It should take less than 5 minutes to get the results. Note that the testing part is very fast. The training part is a little bit time consuming. The reason is that there are a lot of loops in the code which make matlab slow. the code will be optimized in the near future.
- If you have any commments please let me know. Thank you very much!
